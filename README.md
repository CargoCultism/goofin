An unordered repository of stuff I tend to forget.  
* Learning cmake, one mistake at a time. Hopefully.
* Git via command line:
    * git checkout -b <new_branch>
    * git push -u origin <new_branch>
    * See differences between base branch `<base>` (e.g. `main`) and current state of branch (called `<branch>/<branch name>`):  ``git diff `git merge-base <base> <branch>/<branch name>` <branch>/<branch name>``
